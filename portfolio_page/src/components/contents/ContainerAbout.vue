                                        technology. My special experience spans full stack development, network
                                        technologies, data analysis and processing as well as large scale high
                                        performance computing. I am also profound with distributed system engineering,
                                        cloud computing, web security and reverse engineering.</span><span class="p">I
                                        am a computer science student pursuing my MS and work as a full stack software
                                        engineer at Robert Bosch AG.</span><span class="p">Prior to my current
                                        occupation, I was employed at the university as a research assistant to
                                        Professor Stefan Schmid. I developed specialized network components in software
                                        to be integrated into real networks.<br> In my spare time I spend my time on
                                        programming microcontrollers as well as 3d printing technologies and the
                                        modeling techniques that go along with it.</span></p>
